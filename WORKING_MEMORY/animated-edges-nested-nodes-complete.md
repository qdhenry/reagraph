# Animated Edges and Nested Nodes Implementation - Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented animated edges and two-level nested expandable nodes in the benchmarking app to better mirror the components found in the storybook stories.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Type Definitions
- Added `animated`, `interactive`, and `initialCollapsedNodeIds` to `BenchmarkTest` interface
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing tests

### 2. Enhanced GraphRenderer Components
- **GraphRenderer**: Added `animated` prop support with visual indicator
- **GraphRendererV2**: Added `animated` prop and UI toggle control
- Both components now pass animation state to underlying GraphCanvas

### 3. Created CollapsibleGraphRenderer Component
New component with full collapse/expand functionality:
- Supports animated edges via `animated` prop
- Manages collapsed node state with `useCollapse` hook
- Provides UI controls for expand/collapse operations
- Tracks performance metrics for collapse operations
- Shows visual indicators for collapsible nodes
- Displays collapsed node list with individual expand controls

### 4. Added New Benchmark Tests
Added 5 new test configurations to storybookDatasets:
- **Animated Simple Graph**: Basic animation test
- **Animated Complex Network**: 25-node animation performance test
- **Collapsible Hierarchy**: Two-level nested nodes with collapse
- **Animated Collapsible Hierarchy**: Combined animation + collapse features
- **Large Collapsible Network**: Performance test with multiple collapsible nodes

### 5. Updated BenchmarkDashboard
- Integrated CollapsibleGraphRenderer for interactive tests
- Added conditional rendering based on test properties
- Added visual badges for animated (ðŸŽ¥) and interactive (ðŸ”„) tests
- Maintains existing functionality for standard tests

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Animation Support**
   - All renderers now support configurable animations
   - Animation state is displayed in UI
   - Performance impact of animations can be measured

2. **Collapsible Nodes**
   - Two-level hierarchy support (matching storybook parentNodes dataset)
   - Individual node collapse/expand
   - Bulk operations (expand all/collapse all)
   - Visual feedback for collapsed state
   - Performance tracking for collapse operations

3. **Combined Features**
   - Tests can have both animations AND collapsible nodes
   - Performance metrics capture both features' impact
   - Seamless integration with existing benchmark infrastructure

## Testing the New Features

1. Start the benchmark app
2. Look for tests with ðŸŽ¥ (animated) or ðŸ”„ (interactive) badges
3. Try these specific tests:
   - "Collapsible Hierarchy" - Basic collapse functionality
   - "Animated Collapsible Hierarchy" - Both features combined
   - "Large Collapsible Network" - Performance under load

## Next Steps

1. Run performance comparisons between animated vs non-animated tests
2. Measure collapse/expand operation performance on large graphs
3. Consider adding more complex hierarchy levels (3+ levels)
4. Add performance thresholds for interactive operations
