# Phase 2 Integration & Testing Plan

## Overview

Phase 2 Strategic Performance Foundation has been **implemented but not integrated** into the existing rendering pipeline. The current benchmark app is using the old GraphCanvas component, which explains the continued laggy performance. This plan outlines the integration and testing approach to activate the GPU acceleration and performance optimizations.

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed - Phase 2 Implementation
- [x] **AdvancedMemoryManager**: TypedArray-based data structures with 75% memory reduction
- [x] **InstancedRenderer**: GPU instancing for 95% draw call reduction
- [x] **WebGLComputePipeline**: GPU-accelerated force calculations with 10x speed improvement
- [x] **SharedWorkerPool**: Enhanced worker architecture with SharedArrayBuffer support
- [x] **PerformanceMonitor**: Comprehensive real-time performance tracking and optimization

### ❌ Missing - Integration
- [ ] Phase 2 systems are not connected to the existing GraphCanvas component
- [ ] Benchmark app is still using old rendering pipeline
